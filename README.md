# Next-generation sequencing of newborn screening: The accuracy of short read mapping

Here are scripts and data files used in the above mentioned paper that tests the accuracy of short read mapping in newborn screening genes at different read lengths and with different patient's ethnic background taken into condsideration.

Scripts are separated into folders based on analysis type. 

Final bed files of regions in newborn screening genes that are highly homologous with other genomic regions and a problem for NGS short reads at varying read lengths are in the Problem_Region_Bed_Files folder under Final_Bed_Files. There are bed files for both genic and exonic levels with a file that designates each region in the newborn screening gene and another with each alternate hit elsewhere in the genome annotated.
